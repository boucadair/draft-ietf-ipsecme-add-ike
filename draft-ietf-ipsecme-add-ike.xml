      (IKEv2) Configuration Payload Attribute Types to assign DNS resolvers
      that support encrypted DNS protocols.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism to assign encrypted DNS configurations
      to an Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>
      initiator. Specifically, it assigns one or more Authentication Domain Names (ADNs)
      of DNS resolvers that support encrypted DNS protocols. The specific protocols
      supported are described using the Service Parameters format defined in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-add-svcb-dns"></xref>; supported protocols include
      DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>, DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref>, and DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ)
      <xref target="RFC9250"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document introduces three new IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute
      Types (<xref target="RI"></xref>) to add support for encrypted DNS
      resolvers. The ENCDNS_IP4 and ENCDNS_IP6 attribute types are used to provision
      ADNs, a list of IP addresses, and a sets of service parameters. The
      ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute additionally allows a specific resolver certificate
      to be indicated by the IKEv2 responder.</t>

      <t>Sample use cases are described in <xref target="depl"></xref>. The
      Configuration Payload Attribute Types defined in this document are not
      specific to these deployments, but can also be used in other deployment
      contexts. It is out of the scope of this document to provide a
      comprehensive list of deployment contexts.</t>

      <t>The encrypted DNS resolver hosted by a VPN provider can get a
      domain-validate certificate from a public Certificate Authority (CA).
      The VPN client does not need to be provisioned with the root certificate
      of a private CA to authenticate the certificate of the encrypted DNS
      resolvers. The encrypted DNS resolver can run on private IP addresses
      and its access can be restricted to clients connected to the VPN.</t>

      <t>Note that, for many years, typical designs have often considered that
      the DNS resolver was usually located inside the protected domain, but
      could be located outside of it. With encrypted DNS, the latter option
      becomes plausible.</t>

      <t>This section describes how the attributes defined in <xref target="RI"></xref>
      are used to configure an IKEv2 initiator with one or more encrypted DNS resolvers.</t>

      <t>Initiators first indicate support for encrypted DNS by including ENCDNS_IP*
      attributes in their CFG_REQUEST payloads.
      Responders supply encrypted DNS configuration by including ENCDNS_IP* attributes
      in their CFG_REPLY payloads. Concretely:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>If the initiator supports encrypted DNS, it includes either or both
          of the ENCDNS_IP4 and ENCDNS_IP6 attributes in its CFG_REQUEST. If
          the initiator does not want to request specific DNS resolvers, it sets
          the Length field to 0 for the attribute. If the initiator sends multiple 
          attributes of a particular type in the request, all of them MUST be distinct (either be empty or containing different suggested resolvers). The responder SHOULD ignore repeated attributes if they are included in the request. The initiator MAY send
          one or more attributes that include addresses and/or ADN values to
          request specific resolvers. The initiator MAY also include the
          ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute with a list of hash algorithms that
          are supported by the encrypted DNS client.</t>

          <t>For each ENCDNS_IP* attribute from the CFG_REQUEST, if the
          responder supports the corresponding address family, and absent any
          policy restrictions, the responder sends back ENCDNS_IP* attribute(s) in the
          CFG_REPLY with an appropriate list of IP addresses, service
          parameters, and an ADN. The list of IP addresses MUST include at
          least one IP address. The service parameters MUST include at least
          the "alpn" service parameter. The responder MAY ignore suggested values
          from the initiator (if any). Multiple instances of the same ENCDNS_IP*
          attribue MAY be returned if distinct ADNs or service parameters need to
          be assigned to the initiator. In such instances, the different attributes
          can have matching or distinct IP addresses. These instances SHOULD be processed
          by initiators following their service priority (i.e., smaller service priority
          values indicates a higher preference).</t>

          <t>In addition, the responder MAY return the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO
          attribute to convey a digest of the certificate of the encrypted DNS
          and the identifier of the hash algorithm that is used to generate
          the digest.</t>

          <t>If the CFG_REQUEST includes an ENCDNS_IP* attribute but the
          CFG_REPLY does not include an ENCDNS_IP* matching the requested
          address family, this is an indication that requested address family
          is not supported by the responder or the responder is not configured
          to provide corresponding resolver addresses.</t>

          <t>If the initiator receives both ENCDNS_IP* and INTERNAL_IP6_DNS
          (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) attributes, it is RECOMMENDED that the
          initiator uses the encrypted DNS resolvers.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The DNS client establishes an encrypted DNS session (e.g., DoT, DoH,
      DoQ) with the address(es) conveyed in ENCDNS_IP* and uses the mechanism
      discussed in Section 8 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref> to authenticate
      the DNS resolver certificate using the authentication domain name
      conveyed in ENCDNS_IP*.</t>

      <t>If the CFG_REPLY includes an ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute, the DNS
      client has to create a digest of the DNS resolver certificate received
      in the TLS handshake using the negotiated hash algorithm in the
      ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute. If the computed digest for an ADN matches
      the one sent in the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute, the encrypted DNS
      resolver certificate is successfully validated. If so, the client
      continues with the TLS connection as normal. Otherwise, the client MUST
      treat the resolver certificate validation failure as a non-recoverable
      error. This approach is similar to certificate usage PKIX-EE(1) defined
      in <xref target="RFC7671"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If the IPsec connection is a split-tunnel configuration and the
      initiator negotiated INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN as per <xref
      target="RFC8598"></xref>, the DNS client resolves the internal names
      using ENCDNS_IP* DNS resolvers.</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>Note: <xref target="RFC8598"></xref> requires INTERNAL_IP6_DNS
          (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) attribute to be mandatory present when
          INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN is included. This specification relaxes that
          constraint in the presence of ENCDNS_IP* attributes. That is, if
          ENCDNS_IP* attributes are supplied, it is allowed to include
          INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN even in the absence of INTERNAL_IP6_DNS (or
          INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) attributes.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document adheres to the security considerations defined in <xref
      target="RFC7296"></xref>. In particular, this document does not alter
      the trust on the DNS configuration provided by a responder.</t>

      <t>Networks are susceptible to internal attacks as discussed in <xref
      section="3.2" target="I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t"></xref>. Hosting
      encrypted DNS resolvers even in case of split-VPN configuration
      minimizes the attack vector (e.g., a compromised network device cannot
      monitor/modify DNS traffic). This specification describes a mechanism to
      restrict access to the DNS messages to only the parties that need to
      know.</t>

      <t>The initiator may trust the encrypted DNS resolvers supplied by means
      of IKEv2 from a trusted responder more than the locally provided DNS
      resolvers, especially in the case of connecting to unknown or untrusted
      networks (e.g., coffee shops or hotel networks).</t>

      <t>If the IKEv2 responder has used NULL Authentication method <xref
      target="RFC7619"></xref> to authenticate itself, the initiator MUST NOT
      use returned ENCDNS_IP* resolvers configuration unless it is
      pre-configured, e.g., in the operating system or the application.</t>

      <t>This specification does not extend the scope of accepting DNSSEC
      trust anchors beyond the usage guidelines defined in <xref section="6"
      target="RFC8598"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>The mechanism defined in this document can be used to infer that an
      initiator supports encrypted DNS attributes, but does not explicitly
      reveal whether local DNS clients are able to consume these attributes or
      infer their encryption capabilities. Other than that, this document does
      not expose more privacy information compared to Do53 configuration
      attributes.</t>

      <t>As discussed in <xref target="RFC9076"></xref>, the use of encrypted
      DNS does not reduce the data available in the DNS resolver. For example,
      the reader may refer to <xref section="8" target="RFC8484"></xref> or
      <xref section="7" target="RFC9250"></xref> for a discussion on specific
      privacy considerations to encrypted DNS.</t>

    <section anchor="depl" title="Sample Deployment Scenarios">
      <t></t>

      <section title="Roaming Enterprise Users">
        <t>In this Enterprise scenario (Section 1.1.3 of <xref
        target="RFC7296"></xref>), a roaming user connects to the Enterprise
        network through an IPsec tunnel. The split-tunnel Virtual Private
        Network (VPN) configuration allows the endpoint to access hosts that
        resides in the Enterprise network <xref target="RFC8598"></xref> using
        that tunnel; other traffic not destined to the Enterprise does not
        traverse the tunnel. In contrast, a non-split-tunnel VPN configuration
        causes all traffic to traverse the tunnel into the enterprise.</t>

        <t>For both split- and non-split-tunnel configurations, the use of
        encrypted DNS instead of Do53 provides privacy and integrity
        protection along the entire path (rather than just to the VPN
        termination device) and can communicate the encrypted DNS resolver
        policies.</t>

        <t>For split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided encrypted DNS resolver to resolve internal-only
        domain names.</t>

        <t>For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided encrypted DNS resolver to resolve both internal
        and external domain names.</t>

        <t>Enterprise networks are susceptible to internal and external
        attacks. To minimize that risk all enterprise traffic is encrypted
        (Section 2.1 of <xref
        target="I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t"></xref>).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="VPN Service Provider">
        <t>Legacy VPN service providers usually preserve end-users' data
        confidentiality by sending all communication traffic through an
        encrypted tunnel. A VPN service provider can also provide guarantees
        about the security of the VPN network by filtering malware and
        phishing domains.</t>

        <t>Browsers and OSes support DoH/DoT; VPN providers may no longer
        expect DNS clients to fallback to Do53 just because it is a closed
        network.</t>

        <t>The encrypted DNS resolver hosted by the VPN service provider can
        be securely discovered by the endpoint using the IKEv2 Configuration
        Payload Attribute Type.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="DNS Offload">
        <t>VPN service providers typically allow split-tunnel VPN
        configuration in which users can choose applications that can be
        excluded from the tunnel. For example, users may exclude applications
        that restrict VPN access.</t>

        <t>The encrypted DNS resolver hosted by the VPN service provider can
