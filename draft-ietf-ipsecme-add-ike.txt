1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a mechanism to assign encrypted DNS
   configurations to an Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)
   [RFC7296] initiator.  Specifically, it assigns one or more
   Authentication Domain Names (ADNs) of DNS resolvers that support
   encrypted DNS protocols.  The specific protocols supported are
   described using the Service Parameters format defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https]; supported protocols include DNS-over-
   HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], and DNS-over-
   QUIC (DoQ) [RFC9250].

   This document introduces three new IKEv2 Configuration Payload
   Attribute Types (Section 3) to add support for encrypted DNS
   resolvers.  The ENCDNS_IP4 and ENCDNS_IP6 attribute types
   (Section 3.1) are used to provision ADNs, a list of IP addresses, and
   a set of service parameters.  The ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute
   (Section 3.2) additionally allows a specific resolver certificate to
   be indicated by the IKEv2 responder.

   Sample use cases are described in Appendix A.  The Configuration
   Payload Attribute Types defined in this document are not specific to
   these deployments, but can also be used in other deployment contexts.
   It is out of the scope of this document to provide a comprehensive
   list of deployment contexts.

   The encrypted DNS resolver hosted by a VPN provider can get a domain-
   validate certificate from a public Certificate Authority (CA).  The
   VPN client does not need to be provisioned with the root certificate
   of a private CA to authenticate the certificate of the encrypted DNS
   resolvers.  The encrypted DNS resolver can run on private IP
   addresses and its access can be restricted to clients connected to
   the VPN.

   Note that, for many years, typical designs have often considered that
   the DNS resolver was usually located inside the protected domain, but
   could be located outside of it.  With encrypted DNS, the latter
   option becomes plausible.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses of the terms defined in [RFC8499].

   Also, this document uses of the terms defined in [RFC7296].  In
   particular, readers should be familiar with "initiator" and
   "responder" terms used in that document.

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   Do53:  refers to unencrypted DNS.

   Encrypted DNS:  refers to a scheme where DNS messages are sent over
      an encrypted channel.  Examples of encrypted DNS are DoT, DoH, and
      DoQ.

   ENCDNS_IP*:  refers to any IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute
      Types defined in Section 3.1.

3.  IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types for Encrypted DNS

3.1.  ENCDNS_IP* Configuration Payload Attributes

   The ENCDNS_IP* IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types,
   ENCDNS_IP4 and ENCDNS_IP6, are used to configure encrypted DNS
   resolvers to an initiator.  Both attribute types share the format
   that is shown in Figure 1.  The information included in these
   attributes adheres to the recommendation in Section 3.1.9 of
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

                        Figure 1: Attributes Format

   The description of the fields of the attribute shown in Figure 1 is
   as follows:

   *  R (Reserved, 1 bit) - This bit MUST be set to zero and MUST be
      ignored on receipt (see Section 3.15.1 of [RFC7296] for details).

   *  Attribute Type (15 bits) - Identifier for Configuration Attribute
      Type.  This is set to TBA1 for ENCDNS_IP4 or TBA2 for ENCDNS_IP6,
      as registered in Section 7.

   *  Length (2 octets, unsigned integer) - Length of the data in
      octets.  In particular, this field is set to:

      -  0 if the Configuration payload has types CFG_REQUEST (if no
         specific DNS resolver is requested) or CFG_ACK.  If the
         'Length' field is set to 0, then later fields shown in Figure 1
         are not present.

      -  (4 + Length of the ADN + N * 4 + Length of SvcParams) for
         ENCDNS_IP4 attributes if the Configuration payload has types
         CFG_REQUEST or CFG_REPLY or CFG_SET; N being the number of
         included IPv4 addresses ('Num addresses').

      -  (4 + Length of the ADN + N * 16 + Length of SvcParams) for
         ENCDNS_IP6 attributes if the Configuration payload has types
         CFG_REQUEST or CFG_REPLY or CFG_SET; N being the number of
         included IPv6 addresses ('Num addresses').

   *  Service Priority (2 octets) - The priority of this attribute
      compared to other ENCDNS_IP* instances.  This 16-bit unsigned
      integer is interpreted following the rules specified in
      Section 2.4.1 of [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https].

      AliasMode (Section 2.4.2 of [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https]) is not
      supported because such a mode will trigger additional Do53 queries
      while the data can be supplied directly in the IKE response.  As
      such, this field MUST NOT be set to 0.

   *  Num Addresses (1 octet) - Indicates the number of enclosed IPv4
      (for ENCDNS_IP4) or IPv6 (for ENCDNS_IP6) addresses.  This value
      MUST NOT be set to 0 if the Configuration payload is of type
      CFG_REPLY or CFG_SET.

   *  ADN Length (1 octet) - Indicates the length of the "Authentication
      Domain Name" field in octets.

   *  IP Address(es) (variable) - Includes one or more IP addresses that
      can be used to reach the encrypted DNS resolver identified by the
      Authentication Domain Name.  For ENCDNS_IP4 this field contains
      one or more 4-octet IPv4 addresses, and for ENCDNS_IP6 this field
      contains one or more 16-octet IPv6 addresses.

   *  Authentication Domain Name (variable) - A fully qualified domain
      name of the encrypted DNS resolver following the syntax defined in
      [RFC5890].  The name MUST NOT contain any terminators (e.g., NULL,
      CR).

      An example of a valid ADN for DoH server is "doh1.example.com".

   *  Service Parameters (SvcParams) (variable) - Specifies a set of
      service parameters that are encoded following the rules in
      Section 2.1 of [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https].  Section 3.1.5 of
      [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] lists a set of service parameters that are
      recommended to be supported by implementations.

      The service parameters MUST NOT include "ipv4hint" or "ipv6hint"
      SvcParams as they are superseded by the included IP addresses.

      If no port service parameter is included, this indicates that
      default port numbers should be used.  As a reminder, the default
      port number is 853 for DoT, 443 for DoH, and 853 for DoQ.

      The service parameters apply to all IP addresses in the ENCDNS_IP*
      Configuration Payload Attribute.

3.2.  ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO Configuration Payload Attribute

   The ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO configuration payload attribute allows IKEv2
   responders to specify a certificate digest that initiators can use
   when validating TLS connections to encrypted resolvers.  This
   attribute can also be sent by the initiator to request specific hash
   algorithms for such digests.  The format of ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO
   attribute if the Configuration payload has type CFG_REQUEST is shown
   in Figure 2.

        Figure 2: ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO Attribute Format in CFG_REQUEST

   The description of the fields of the attribute shown in Figure 2 is
   as follows:

   *  R (Reserved, 1 bit) - This bit MUST be set to zero and MUST be
      ignored on receipt (see Section 3.15.1 of [RFC7296] for details).

   *  Attribute Type (15 bits) - Identifier for Configuration Attribute
      Type; is set to TBA3 value listed in Section 7.

   *  Length (2 octets, unsigned integer) - Length of the data in
      octets.

   *  RESERVED (3 octets) - These bits are reserved for future use.
      These bits MUST be set to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored
      by the receiver.

   *  Num Hash Algs (1 octet) - Indicates the number of included hash
      algorithm identifiers.  This field MUST be set to "0.5*(Length -
      4)".

   *  ADN Length (1 octet) - MUST be set to 0.

   *  List of Hash Algorithm Identifiers (variable) - Specifies a list
      of 16-bit hash algorithm identifiers that are supported by the
      encrypted DNS client.

      The values of this field are taken from the Hash Algorithm
      Identifiers of IANA's "Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)
      Parameters" registry [IANA-IKE-HASH].

      There is no padding between the hash algorithm identifiers.

      Note that SHA2-256 is mandatory to implement.

   The format of ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute if the Configuration
   payload has types CFG_REPLY or CFG_SET is shown in Figure 3.

   *  R (Reserved, 1 bit) - This bit MUST be set to zero and MUST be
      ignored on receipt (see Section 3.15.1 of [RFC7296] for details).

   *  Attribute Type (15 bits) - Identifier for Configuration Attribute
      Type; is set to TBA3 value listed in Section 7.

   *  Length (2 octets, unsigned integer) - Length of the data in
      octets.

Internet-Draft           IKEv2 for Encrypted DNS            January 2023


   *  RESERVED (3 octets) - These bits are reserved for future use.
      These bits MUST be set to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored
      by the receiver.

   *  Num Hash Algs (1 octet) - MUST be set to 1.

   *  ADN Length (1 octet) - Indicates the length of the "Authentication
      Domain Name" field in octets.  When set to '0', this means that
      the digest applies on the ADN conveyed in the ENCDNS_IP*
      Configuration Payload Attribute(s).

   *  Authentication Domain Name (variable) - A fully qualified domain
      name of the encrypted DNS resolver following the syntax defined in
      [RFC5890].  The name MUST NOT contain any terminators (e.g., NULL,
      CR).  A name is included only when multiple ADNs are included in
      the ENCDNS_IP* Configuration Payload Attributes.

   *  Hash Algorithm Identifier (2 octets) - Specifies the 16-bit hash
      algorithm identifier selected by the DNS resolver to generate the
      digest of its certificate.

   *  Certificate Digest (variable) - This field includes the SPKI hash
      of the encrypted DNS resolver certificate using the algorithm
      identified in the 'Hash Algorithm Identifier' field.  The length
      of this field is "Length - 6 - ADN Length".

   The ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute may be present in the Configuration
   payload of CFG_ACK.  In such a case, the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO MUST be
   returned with zero-length data.

   As discussed in Section 3.15.1 of [RFC7296], there are no defined
   uses for the CFG_SET/CFG_ACK exchange.  The use of
   theENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute for these messages is provided for
   completeness.

4.  IKEv2 Protocol Exchange

   This section describes how the attributes defined in Section 3 are
   used to configure an IKEv2 initiator with one or more encrypted DNS
   resolvers.

   Initiators first indicate support for encrypted DNS by including
   ENCDNS_IP* attributes in their CFG_REQUEST payloads.  Responders
   supply encrypted DNS configuration by including ENCDNS_IP* attributes
   in their CFG_REPLY payloads.  Concretely:

Internet-Draft           IKEv2 for Encrypted DNS            January 2023


      If the initiator supports encrypted DNS, it includes either or
      both of the ENCDNS_IP4 and ENCDNS_IP6 attributes in its
      CFG_REQUEST.  If the initiator does not want to request specific
      DNS resolvers, it sets the Length field to 0 for the attribute.
      For a given attribute type, the initiator MAY send either an empty
      attribute or a list of distinct suggested resolvers.  The
      initiator MAY also include the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute with a
      list of hash algorithms that are supported by the encrypted DNS
      client.

      If the request includes multiple bitwise identical attributes,
      only the first occurrence is processed, and the rest SHOULD be
      ignored by the responder.  The responder MAY discard the full
      request if the count of repeated attributes exceeds an
      (implementation specific) threshold.

      For each ENCDNS_IP* attribute from the CFG_REQUEST, if the
      responder supports the corresponding address family, and absent
      any policy restrictions, the responder sends back ENCDNS_IP*
      attribute(s) in the CFG_REPLY with an appropriate list of IP
      addresses, service parameters, and an ADN.  The list of IP
      addresses MUST include at least one IP address.  The service
      parameters MUST include at least the "alpn" service parameter.
      The responder MAY ignore suggested values from the initiator (if
      any).  Multiple instances of the same ENCDNS_IP* attribute MAY be
      returned if distinct ADNs or service parameters need to be
      assigned to the initiator.  In such instances, the different
      attributes can have matching or distinct IP addresses.  These
      instances SHOULD be processed by initiators following their
      service priority (i.e., smaller service priority values indicates
      a higher preference).

      In addition, the responder MAY return the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO
      attribute to convey a digest of the certificate of the encrypted
      DNS and the identifier of the hash algorithm that is used to
      generate the digest.

      If the CFG_REQUEST includes an ENCDNS_IP* attribute but the
      CFG_REPLY does not include an ENCDNS_IP* matching the requested
      address family, this is an indication that requested address
      family is not supported by the responder or the responder is not
      configured to provide corresponding resolver addresses.

      If the initiator receives both ENCDNS_IP* and INTERNAL_IP6_DNS (or
      INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) attributes, it is RECOMMENDED that the initiator
      uses the encrypted DNS resolvers.

Internet-Draft           IKEv2 for Encrypted DNS            January 2023


   The DNS client establishes an encrypted DNS session (e.g., DoT, DoH,
   DoQ) with the address(es) conveyed in ENCDNS_IP* and uses the
   mechanism discussed in Section 8 of [RFC8310] to authenticate the DNS
   resolver certificate using the authentication domain name conveyed in
   ENCDNS_IP*.

   If the CFG_REPLY includes an ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute, the client
   has to create an SPKI hash of the DNS resolver certificate received
   in the TLS handshake using the negotiated hash algorithm in the
   ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute.  If the computed digest for an ADN
   matches the one sent in the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute, the
   encrypted DNS resolver certificate is successfully validated.  If so,
   the client continues with the TLS connection as normal.  Otherwise,
   the client MUST treat the resolver certificate validation failure as
   a non-recoverable error.  This approach is similar to certificate
   usage PKIX-EE(1) with selector SPKI(1) defined in [RFC7671] but
   without PKIX validation.

   If the IPsec connection is a split-tunnel configuration and the
   initiator negotiated INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN as per [RFC8598], the DNS
   client resolves the internal names using ENCDNS_IP* DNS resolvers.

      Note: [RFC8598] requires INTERNAL_IP6_DNS (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS)
      attribute to be mandatory present when INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN is
      included.  This specification relaxes that constraint in the
      presence of ENCDNS_IP* attributes.  That is, if ENCDNS_IP*
      attributes are supplied, it is allowed to include
      INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN even in the absence of INTERNAL_IP6_DNS (or
      INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) attributes.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document adheres to the security considerations defined in
   [RFC7296].  In particular, this document does not alter the trust on
   the DNS configuration provided by a responder.

   Networks are susceptible to internal attacks as discussed in
   Section 3.2 of [I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t].  Hosting encrypted
   DNS resolvers even in case of split-VPN configuration minimizes the
   attack vector (e.g., a compromised network device cannot monitor/
   modify DNS traffic).  This specification describes a mechanism to
   restrict access to the DNS messages to only the parties that need to
   know.

   The initiator may trust the encrypted DNS resolvers supplied by means
   of IKEv2 from a trusted responder more than the locally provided DNS
   resolvers, especially in the case of connecting to unknown or
   untrusted networks (e.g., coffee shops or hotel networks).

Internet-Draft           IKEv2 for Encrypted DNS            January 2023


   If the IKEv2 responder has used NULL Authentication method [RFC7619]
   to authenticate itself, the initiator MUST NOT use returned
   ENCDNS_IP* resolvers configuration unless it is pre-configured, e.g.,
   in the operating system or the application.

   This specification does not extend the scope of accepting DNSSEC
   trust anchors beyond the usage guidelines defined in Section 6 of
   [RFC8598].

6.  Privacy Considerations

   As discussed in [RFC9076], the use of encrypted DNS does not reduce
   the data available in the DNS resolver.  For example, the reader may
   refer to Section 8 of [RFC8484] or Section 7 of [RFC9250] for a
   discussion on specific privacy considerations to encrypted DNS.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign the following new IKEv2
   Configuration Payload Attribute Types from the "IKEv2 Configuration
   Payload Attribute Types" namespace available at [IANA-IKE-CFG].

                                  Multi-
   Value  Attribute Type          Valued  Length     Reference
   ------ ------------------       -----  ---------  ---------
    TBA1  ENCDNS_IP4                YES   0 or more  RFC XXXX
    TBA2  ENCDNS_IP6                YES   0 or more  RFC XXXX
    TBA3  ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO        YES   0 or more  RFC XXXX

8.  Acknowledgements

   Many thanks to Yoav Nir, Christian Jacquenet, Paul Wouters, and Tommy
   Pauly for the review and comments.

   Yoav and Paul suggested the use of one single attribute carrying both
   the name and an IP address instead of depending on the existing
   INTERNAL_IP6_DNS and INTERNAL_IP4_DNS attributes.

   Thanks to Tero Kivinen for the Shepherd review.

Appendix A.  Sample Deployment Scenarios


A.1.  Roaming Enterprise Users

   In this Enterprise scenario (Section 1.1.3 of [RFC7296]), a roaming
   user connects to the Enterprise network through an IPsec tunnel.  The
   split-tunnel Virtual Private Network (VPN) configuration allows the
   endpoint to access hosts that reside in the Enterprise network
   [RFC8598] using that tunnel; other traffic not destined to the
   Enterprise does not traverse the tunnel.  In contrast, a non-split-
   tunnel VPN configuration causes all traffic to traverse the tunnel
   into the Enterprise.

   For both split- and non-split-tunnel configurations, the use of
   encrypted DNS instead of Do53 provides privacy and integrity
   protection along the entire path (rather than just to the VPN
   termination device) and can communicate the encrypted DNS resolver
   policies.

   For split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
   Enterprise-provided encrypted DNS resolver to resolve internal-only
   domain names.

   For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
   Enterprise-provided encrypted DNS resolver to resolve both internal
   and external domain names.

   Enterprise networks are susceptible to internal and external attacks.
   To minimize that risk all enterprise traffic is encrypted
   (Section 2.1 of [I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t]).

A.2.  VPN Service Provider

   Legacy VPN service providers usually preserve end-users' data
   confidentiality by sending all communication traffic through an
   encrypted tunnel.  A VPN service provider can also provide guarantees
   about the security of the VPN network by filtering malware and
   phishing domains.

   Browsers and operating systems support DoH/DoT; VPN providers may no
   longer expect DNS clients to fall back to Do53 just because it is a
   closed network.

Internet-Draft           IKEv2 for Encrypted DNS            January 2023


   The encrypted DNS resolver hosted by the VPN service provider can be
   securely discovered by the endpoint using the IKEv2 attributes
   specified in Section 3.1.

A.3.  DNS Offload

   VPN service providers typically allow split-tunnel VPN configuration
   in which users can choose applications that can be excluded from the
   tunnel.  For example, users may exclude applications that restrict
   VPN access.

   The encrypted DNS resolver hosted by the VPN service provider can be
   securely discovered by the endpoint using the IKEv2 attributes
   specified in Section 3.1.

Appendix B.  Examples

   The following depicts an example of a CFG_REQUEST to request the
   configuration of IPv6 DNS resolvers without providing any suggested
   values.  In this example, the initiator uses the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO
   attribute to indicate that the encrypted DNS client supports SHA2-256
   (2), SHA2-384 (3), and SHA2-512 (4) hash algorithms.  The label of
   these algoirthms is taken from [IANA-IKE-HASH].  The use of
   INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS is explained in [RFC7296] and this not
   reiterated here.

   CP(CFG_REQUEST) =
     INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS()
     INTERNAL_IP6_DNS()
     ENCDNS_IP6()
     ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO(0, (SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512))

   The following depicts an example of a CFG_REPLY that can be sent by a
   responder as a response the above CFG_REQUEST.  This response
   indicates the following information to identify the encrypted DNS
   resolver:

   *  Its IPv6 address (2001:db8:99:88:77:66:55:44)

   *  Its authentication domain name (doh.example.com)

   *  Its supported HTTP version (h2)

   *  The relative form of the URI Template (/dns-query{?dns})

   *  The SPKI hash of the resolver's certificate using SHA2-256
      (8b6e7a5971cc6bb0b4db5a71...)

Internet-Draft           IKEv2 for Encrypted DNS            January 2023


   CP(CFG_REPLY) =
     INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS(2001:db8:0:1:2:3:4:5/64)
     ENCDNS_IP6(1, 1, 15,
                   (2001:db8:99:88:77:66:55:44),
                   "doh.example.com",
                   (alpn=h2 dohpath=/dns-query{?dns}))
     ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO(0, SHA2-256,
                           8b6e7a5971cc6bb0b4db5a71...)

   In this example, no ADN is included in the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO
   attribute because only one ADN is provided in the ENCDNS_IP6
   attribute.  There is no ambiguity to identify the encrypted resolver
   associated with the supplied digest.

   An initiator may provide suggested values in the CFG_REQUEST when
   requesting an encrypted DNS resolver.  For example, the initiator
   may:

   *  Indicate a preferred resolver that is identified by an IPv6
      address

      CP(CFG_REQUEST) =
        INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS()
        INTERNAL_IP6_DNS()
        ENCDNS_IP6(1, 1, 0,
                      (2001:db8:99:88:77:66:55:44))

   *  Indicate a preferred resolver that is identified by an ADN

      CP(CFG_REQUEST) =
        INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS()
        INTERNAL_IP6_DNS()
        ENCDNS_IP6(1, 0, 15, "doh.example.com")

   *  Indicate a preferred transport protocol (DoT, in this example)

      CP(CFG_REQUEST) =
        INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS()
        INTERNAL_IP6_DNS()
        ENCDNS_IP6(1, 0, 0, (alpn=dot))

   *  or any combination thereof.
